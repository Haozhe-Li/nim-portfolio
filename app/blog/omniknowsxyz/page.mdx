- **Fast Mode:** Omni rapidly scans webpages, delivering results within seconds to ensure users receive information without delay.
- **Omni Mode:** This mode showcases Omni's full potential. By employing advanced reasoning capabilities, Omni meticulously interprets user queries, analyzing them word by word. It explores a broader range of sources—three times more than conventional methods—synthesizing comprehensive results, evaluating their quality, and iteratively improving to guarantee the most accurate and reliable answers.

## Technologies and Architecture

### Frontend

Omni utilizes Vercel and Cloudflare to ensure swift webpage delivery, global accessibility, and a seamless user experience.

### Backend

Omni employs a multi-agent architecture for its backend. When a user submits a query, Omni decomposes it into multiple sub-questions, enabling a broader and more granular search across diverse sources. The system then aggregates, summarizes, and reasons over the collected data to construct an initial response. 

To ensure the highest quality, an evaluation layer is introduced to validate and refine the output. This iterative process allows Omni to self-optimize, ensuring that only the most accurate and insightful answers are delivered to users.

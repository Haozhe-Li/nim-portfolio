# Omni Knows XYZ FAQ

## Which languages does Omni support?
Currently, Omni supports 3 languages: English, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), and Japanese. You can explicitly select your preferred response language in the preferences.

By default, language is automatically detected based on your input. You can always change from "Auto" to any of the 3 supported languages.

For the interface language in Omni, only English is supported at the moment.

Expanding language support is on our roadmap and will be available in future updates.

## What does Personalization with Precise Location mean?
By enabling this feature, Omni will request your precise location (based on GPS) to provide more relevant and localized responses. A popup may appear requesting permission to access your location.

When granted, this allows Omni to tailor its responses based on your specific location, enhancing the overall user experience with personalized news, weather, and local events.

## Is personalization still available if I don't share my precise location?

Yes, Omni will still use your IP address, local date/time, and timezone for personalization purposes. This means that even without precise location data, Omni can still offer relevant responses based on your general location and context.

However, the accuracy and relevance of the responses may be limited compared to when precise location data is available.

## What does Faster Response with Cache mean?
Faster Response with Cache is a feature that allows Omni to check our internal vector database first before performing a fresh search on the internet. By leveraging cached data, Omni can provide quicker responses when users ask about similar topics, reducing the need for repetitive searches and improving overall efficiency.

If you disable this feature, Omni will always perform a fresh web search, which may result in slightly slower response times.

Please note that in Omni Light Mode, this feature is always enabled and cannot be disabled as it is essential for maintaining performance in that mode.

## What does AI Data Retention mean?
AI Data Retention allows Omni to collect and store web search results that Omni has accessed during your sessions. All this information is securely anonymized and cannot be traced back to you.

Here's how this works:

1. When you ask a question (e.g., "Who is Cristiano Ronaldo?"), Omni retrieves information from the web and stores the search results. Normally, Omni might search Google with queries like: "Cristiano Ronaldo Wikipedia", "Cristiano Ronaldo biography", "Cristiano Ronaldo career".
2. When you have AI Data Retention enabled, Omni will store the search results and queries generated by Omni, which in this example would be "Cristiano Ronaldo", "Cristiano Ronaldo biography", "Cristiano Ronaldo career".
3. All this information is stored in our internal vector database, where the information is anonymized and no one can identify who initiated those questions.
4. Next time when someone asks a similar question, Omni can retrieve the relevant information from the vector database, providing a faster and more accurate response (if they have enabled Faster Response with Cache).

You can always disable this feature to stop providing new data to the vector database. However, since all existing data has been cleaned and anonymized, we cannot delete any existing data because we don't know who initiated those questions.

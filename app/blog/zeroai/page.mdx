This project aims to determine whether an input text is artificially generated or created by humans using machine learning and natural language processing. The following sections will introduce the project's overall architecture, module functions, and core processes.

## What is ZeroAI

ZeroAI is a machine learning-based discriminator that can be used to predict whether a piece of text is generated by AI. For a given output text, ZeroAI can predict whether it is generated by AI and provide the probability of its AI generation. Unlike other classification classifiers on the market based on neural networks (NN), ZeroAI has strong generalizability and is less affected by language. ZeroAI can also predict whether a text is generated by AI sentence by sentence.

## Working Principle

### Basic Idea

If you often use ChatGPT and similar tools, you may have the ability to distinguish between texts created by AI and genuine work. AI-generated texts tend to have the following characteristics:

1. Lack of diversity, style tends to focus on consistency.

2. Three-point structure: Introduction, point of view, and summary.

3. Logicalness has high flexibility lack individual expression.

Although these features can be used as references, they cannot be used as a way to judge whether a text is created by AI. Therefore, we use machine learning techniques to capture the fine-grained features of the text and make a more accurate prediction. ZeroAI uses a pre-trained GPT-2 model to calculate the perplexity value of the text, which is a measure of the indicator of text tone and diversity. We convert all input text into multiple perplexity values and learn the features by machine learning models to predict whether the text is written by AI.

### Key Procedures

1. **Input Text**: The user inputs the text to be detected.

2. **Text preprocessing**：The text is cleaned and sent to the sentence, and the input validity is ensured.

3. **Perplexity calculation**: Use the GPT-2 model to calculate the perplexity value of each sentence.

4. **Feature extraction**: Extract features such as average perplexity, maximum perplexity, sentence number, and continuous low perplexity segment.

5. **Machine Learning Judgment**: The extracted features are input into the random forest model, and the probability of the text being generated by AI is output.

### Accuracy

In the test, ZeroAI's accuracy reached 97% as follows:

```plaintext
precision  recall  f1-score

Human  0.97  0.97 0.97

AI  0.97  0.97 0.97

accuracy  0.97

macro avg  0.97  0.97 0.97

weighted avg  0.97  0.97 0.97

```

It's worth noting that our test only targeted English texts and was not trained on non-English materials. Yet, thanks to the strong generalizability of the GPT-2 model, ZeroAI could theoretically classify all common languages, including Chinese, Japanese, French, etc., but accuracy has not been verified.

### Training and Open Source

ZeroAI's code is open sourced on GitHub. Users can freely download and develop.

## FAQ

#### Q: How do I use the ZeroAI classifier?

A：Please visit [zeroai.haozheli.com](https://zeroai.haozheli.com) on the webpage or input the text to be processed, then click the "Analysis" button.

#### Q: How am I supposed to understand ZeroAI's analysis results?

A：ZeroAI will output the following information:

- **Label**: The result of the text classification, displayed as generated by AI or handwritten.

- **Likelihood Score**: The probability of the text being generated by AI, ranging from 0% to 100%.

If you click to view the detailed report, you will also get:

- How many sentences are detected as being written by AI.

- The average perplexity value.

- Detailed analysis of each sentence, and highlight the potential AI-generated sentence.

#### Q. What's the accuracy of ZeroAI?

A：ZeroAI has achieved an accuracy of at least 97% in multiple tests. Please check the specifics in the "Working Principle" section. Please note: this AI detection tool provides analysis based on statistical patterns, the result should be interpreted as a probability indicator, not an absolute judgment.

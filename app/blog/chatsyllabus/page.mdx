## Technologies and How It Works

**Chat Syllabus** is a web application powered by advanced AI models. Here's an overview of the technologies we use to deliver a seamless experience:

### Frontend

Our frontend is built with React, enabling dynamic rendering of web pages. We deploy the application using Vercel and Cloudflare for optimal performance. Additionally, the frontend handles the storage of text embeddings for uploaded syllabi directly in the user's browser. This eliminates the need for a backend database, ensuring data privacy and efficiency.

### Backend

The backend is powered by Python and the FastAPI framework, managing requests from the frontend. As a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application, we utilize OpenAI's Davinci model for text embeddings and deploy Groq's LLaMa 3.3 8B and LLaMa 3.3 70B models for fast, accurate text-based responses.
